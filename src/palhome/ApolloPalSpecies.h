// Every Pal species, keyed by a stable string id: Reborn's own "enum".
//
// Apollo's species are a closed Swift enum (`Apollo.PixelPal`, 16 no-payload
// cases stored in one byte; Optional's nil is tag 16 and its switch jump
// tables have no bounds check), so we never extend it. Instead this table is
// the source of truth for Pal Home, the shelter and the widget. The first 16
// rows mirror Apollo's cases (`apolloCase` = their rawValue); Reborn species
// have no case and reach Apollo's island through the store's island channel
// (see ApolloPalHomeStore). Ids are plain strings so a species this build
// doesn't know (from a newer build, or a visiting Pal) round-trips untouched.
// Foundation only.
