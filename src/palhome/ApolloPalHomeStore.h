//  - "apollo.<species>" residents are Apollo's own Pals: their name, hearts
//    and age live in Apollo's PixelPalsDatabase (one per species, its rule).
//  - "pal.<uuid>" residents are Reborn's: any species, as many as you like.
//    Their stats live in the Pal Home document.
//
// Apollo's island can only show one of its 16 enum cases, so a Reborn
// resident reaches it through the *island channel*: while it's the active
// Pal, it borrows a spare Apollo slot (a species you don't own). Its name and
// stats are written into that slot's native record, ActivePixelPal points at
// the slot, and the sprite hook draws the resident there instead. When you
// switch away, the slot's stats (hearts earned, kilometres scrolled) are
// copied back to the resident and the slot is returned exactly as it was.
// Apollo never sees a value outside its enum.
